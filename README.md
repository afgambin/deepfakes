Advances in Deep Learning (DL), Big Data and image processing have facilitated online disinformation spreading through Deepfakes. This entails severe threats including public opinion manipulation, geopolitical tensions, chaos in financial markets, scams, defamation and identity theft among others. 

Therefore, it is imperative to develop techniques to prevent, detect, and stop the spreading of deepfake content. This is the goal of this project.
